<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm ibrahim currently I'm a student at the moment, who's very passionate about the whole world of tech! Currently I'm just doing a few
  courses to learn skills and pick them up on the way. So then i can apply them or use them when needed to!
  Perhaps I need to start posting some repositories dont i? Otherwise my projects will stay rotting in my computer.
</p>

<p>I have quite a lot of hobbies ranging from making projects on my computer and diving in the world of tech
  Another hobby that i have is art since it lets me decompress and de-stress in a way and lets me get away from the real world
  I love learning languages and i dedicate to it every day of my life constantly striving to be better and better day by day as that's 
  what matters right? To become the best version of ourselves.
